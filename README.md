# Kaufen - Angular 18+ Shopping Cart Demo

A modern shopping cart application showcasing the latest Angular features and best practices, particularly focusing on the new Signals API and reactive patterns.

## Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Built with Angular 18+
- ðŸ“¡ Uses the new Resource API for data fetching
- ðŸ’¡ Signal-based state management
- ðŸŽ¨ Brutalist design system
- ðŸ›’ Shopping cart functionality
- ðŸ”„ Reactive UI updates

## Technical Highlights

### Signals

- Cart state management using `signal()` and `computed()`
- Reactive product listing with signal-based data store
- Two-way state synchronization with localStorage

### Resource API

```typescript
productResource = resource({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.products;
  }
}).asReadonly();
```

### Modern Angular Patterns

- Standalone Components
- Input Signals (`input()`)
- Output Events (`output()`)
- Dependency Injection with `inject()`
- Template Control Flow (`@if`, `@for`)

### Component Architecture

- Reusable Sidebar Component
- Skeleton Loading UI
- Cart Service with Signal-based state
- Product Service with Resource API

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart/                 # Cart components and service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ productlisting/       # Product listing components

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skeletonloader/  # Loading skeleton components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.ts               # Root component
```
